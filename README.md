# Advent of Code 2023

My attempt at the 25*2 challenges from the [2023 Advent of
Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023) challenge.

:star: means just the first star, :star2: means both stars, and :custard: (just
because "custard" showed up while searching for emojis with "star" in the name)
means no stars and the day is in the past. I suspect I'll be very behind the
daily-rate, as the days get busier through December...

Times to run are just one example run, in milliseconds (unless specified otherwise).

| Days | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| Stars | :star2: | :star2: | :star2: | :star2: | :star2: | :star2: | :star2: | :star2: | :star2: |  |
| Time | 50 | 51 | 72 | 49 | 37 | 6706 | 46 | 293 | 40 |  |
